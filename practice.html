				<p>This site is really just to practice some new skillz I'm learning.  But while I do that I will tell you a little about me.</p>
				<p>Below you will find a few things that descibe who I am.  I love being active, but also enjoy relaxing and watching movies or listening to music.  Those enjoyments keep me busy as not only do I enjoy them, but I also love to improve my skills and seek to obtain new talents.  So apart from the learning to build websites like this one, I am also trying to teach myself the piano.  And as always continue to exersize and stay compitetive at sports.  Other skills I hope to work on are knott tying(since I like outdoors, it will be good to know more knots) and even look into getting CPR certified( you never know when you may need to help someone)</p>
